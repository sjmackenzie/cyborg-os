Cyborg
======

Cyborg will be an desktop environment for mobile platforms, but for now it's a text editor on steriods.

Features
========

* built on a solid well researched language that offers multiple programming paradigms, or the right tool for the job.
* a single predictable user interface that works on tablets and desktops alike.
* the ability to develop applications that do not subscribe to the single silo philosophy. These applications are inherently distributed.
* a market place geared towards community participation based on the (below) C4 process.
* a currency built on bitcoin.
* All source code, both platform and applications are free and open source.

Who owns Cyborg?
================
Cyborg is owned by all its authors and contributors. All code belonging to the platform and applications are free and open source, licensed under the AGPLv3. To contribute to Cyborg please read the [C4 process](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:16).

Why another operating system?
=============================
Kernels are taken for granted nowadays. Everything is an emulation away. Interest in computing has shifted to userland. Specifically userland on mobile devices such as tablets.

Much can be done on tablets of today though things are quirky and just don't feel easy. Microsoft with windows 8 and Ubuntu with its Unity have created an operating system for the consumer. They are afterall in the majority, hence the market is there. What of the producer who wishes to develop applications and products on tablets?

Enter Cyborg.
-------------

Cyborg has a single user interface based on Rob Pike's Plan 9 editor ACME. It is a proven editor that does more than just edit documents. The typical GNU/Linux user still uses the command line to interact with the computer. The 80's brought about the next iteration; sam a step up from ed. Not being sufficiently powerful Pike set about creating ACME. A 3 button mouse driven editor that doesn't aim to do everything, instead it expects that you already have all your development tools setup, it simply acts as a convenient proxy to your tools.

Cyborg goes one step further.
-----------------------------

Cyborg application developers create rich interactive programs that can be executed within the Cyborg ACME editor called cyborgio by a single middle mouse button click.
